# DOOM: Cyberaugumented
Do you ever imagine if a dark monster randomizer with some spice to it and an inspired weapon mod fused each other? This is what you would get.

## What is it about?
In this mod, there will be new and challenging variations of all monsters and a new set of weapons along with the classic ones. There will be brand new things such as the Temperature System and the Weapon modules based on 2016/Eternal.

# How do I download this??
All you have to do is just go to the [ZDoom site](zdoom.org/downloads) and download the latest GZDoom version. The current version of GZDoom recommended for Cyberaugumented is **4.9**. Then you would need to get the latest build of Cyberaugumented when you click the **Code** button.

# Information
## The Monsters
The themes around monsters are meant to be less cartoony and more dark, inspired by Project Malice and Insanity's Requiem. At times there might be blue-fluid infused possessed and demon androids, while at times there might be monsters with flames, sometimes flames are combined with chemicals like copper, some hellish spirits and occult entities, and probably more. Matter of fact, there will be some elites patrolling and wandering around places you'd never expect. Hell, you might even get a warning if you're nearby one of the more feral ones.

## Your Arsenal
The weapon set you start with is completely similar to ye olde Classic Doom, but with SOME new types of guns. I

## The Temperature System
During levels, you can check the temperature to see if it's hot or cold. Sometimes you WANT to be careful of extreme temperatures. Keep in mind in certain areas where lava or burning barrels are present, there will be more hotter enemies to stumble against. During ice themed levels, you will be more likely to confront colder enemies.

## Progression 
Heavily inspired by Pandemonia. Upon completing maps, etc, you will start to face more entitites that will kick your ass.

## Weapon Modules
Directly inspired from DOOM (2016) and Doom Eternal. There will be weapon mods scattered around some places and dropped from special monsters. Once you picked something up, it will be directly added to the Arsenal Menuâ€”which is, in fact, the main home for modifying weapons and more.
